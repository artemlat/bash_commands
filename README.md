# Linux terminal (GitBash) commands
*Here I learned to use basic Linux terminal commands. I made some tasks to improve my practice skills. There are some of them:*
### 1. Check where I am: `pwd`
### 2. Create a folder: `mkdir linux_terminal`
### 3. Go to the created folder: `cd linux_terminal`
### 4. Make 3 new folders: mkdir `folder_1 folder_2 folder_3`
### 5. Go to any of these folders: `cd folder_1`
### 6. Create 5 files (3 x .txt, 2 x .json): `touch 1j.json  1t.txt  2j.json  2t.txt  3t.txt`
### 7. Create 3 folders: `mkdir first_folder second_folder third_folder`
### 8. Show folder content list: `ls -la`
### 9. Open some of created txt files: `cat >> 1t.txt`
